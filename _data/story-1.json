    "layer1_text": "<p>The <em>Painting of the lands, marshes, and swamps of the town of Bogotá</em> is a manuscript that works both as a map and as a landscape painting and belongs to the genre of legal maps.</p>\n<p>While most legal maps were outlines or simple plans, this map is special not only for its use of color and elaborate designs, but because it is signed by its author, Juan de Aguilar Rendón, who identified himself as painter, and Alonso Ruiz Gadálmez, the guarantor.</p>\n<p>The full title is <em>Painting of the lands, marshes, and swamps of the town of Bogotá, made by order of the Royal Audiencia of this city of Santafé of the New Kingdom of Granada, for proceedings between the crown prosecutor and don Francisco Maldonado de Mendoza. By us, Alonso Ruiz Gadálmez, receptor, and Juan de Aguilar Rendón, painter, in the month of April of the year 1614</em>.</p>\n<p>The acknowledgement of authorship is a rare occurrence both in legal maps and in colonial paintings in the New Kingdom of Granada. At the time, the concept of authorship itself had a very different meaning from the one we use today. The signature, the use of the term \"painting,\" and the use of color are indications that the author was also creating a piece that could be appreciated for its aesthetic qualities.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the signatures of the painter and guarantor ensured the validity of the land survey and legitimized its use in court as a truthful representation of the territory.</p>\n<p>Although we do not know the origin of the paints used on the map, the production of inks and colors was a complex process involving vegetable and animal pigments that were then transformed into paint using methods rich with cultural significance. We have evidence that the Muisca and other Indigenous groups used a wide palette of blue, red, and brown pigments which they applied to designs on textiles, rocks, and other surfaces. For this reason, it is possible that some of the colors used in the <em>Painting</em> were produced using Indigenous methods.</p>\n<p>Another important aspect of the <em>Painting's</em> visualization of the landscape is its scale. Unlike contemporary maps, which guarantee precision by maintaining a single scale throughout the image, the Painting uses a multiple, flexible, and variable scale. The center of the map—which represents the territory disputed by Maldonado y Mendoza and the crown prosecutor—uses a more homogeneous scale, whereas the borders are variable, allowing the observer to see relatively remote landmarks like the city of Santafé and the towns of Fontibón and Madrid as points of reference.</p>",

He studied in Europe and became interested in natural history. This allowed him to join the Royal Botanical Expedition in New Granada in 1803 as the person in charge of the zoological project. Given his high social and economic status, Lozano owned numerous estates in different climates, which made collecting animals for his zoological work easier. He went on to write <em>The Fauna of Cundinamarca</em> and participated in the publication of <em>Correo curioso, erudito, económico y mercantil de la ciudad de Santa Fe de Bogotá</em>, one of the first enlightened journals of the Republic. His work was part of the Spanish Crown's wider search for ways to promote colonial economies through scientific expeditions during the Enlightenment, specifically aiming to identify new products and commodities for export.</p>\n<p>As part of his administrative duties within the Spanish empire, Lozano was named lieutenant protector of the Indigenous peoples of Bosa, Fusagasugá, and Usaquén in 1807. With the consolidation of the first government of the Republic, Lozano served as the first president of the United Provinces of New Granada, only to be deposed in 1811 in a coup d'état led by Antonio Nariño. After the Reconquista, Pablo Morillo's forces shot Lozano on July 6th, 1816 for his participation in republican politics in what is now the <em>Plaza de Los Mártires</em>.<br />\n:::</p>",
