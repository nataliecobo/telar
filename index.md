## Welcome 
This small demo uses Telar, a framework for visual storytelling we have been developing at [Neogranadina](https://neogranadina.org/en) and the Archives, Memory, and Preservation labs at UC Santa Barbara and UT Austin. Telar is designed to allow students and scholars across disciplines to create public-facing and pedagogical narratives for use within and beyond the classroom. You can use Telar to build your own visual narrative exhibition by visiting:

- Our **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/UCSB-AMPLab/telar)**, where you can copy the template to create your own project
- The **[documentation site](https://ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar-docs)**, where you can find guides and tutorials
