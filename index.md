## Welcome 
This small demo uses Telar, a framework for visual storytelling developed by Neogranadina and the Archives, Memory, and Preservation labs at UC Santa Barbara and UT Austin. You can use Telar to build your own visual narrative exhibition by visiting:

- Our **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/UCSB-AMPLab/telar)**, where you can copy the template to create your own project
- The **[documentation site](https://ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar-docs)**, where you can find guides and tutorials
