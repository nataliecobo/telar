# About Telar

Telar (Spanish for 'loom') is a static site generator built on Jekyll that weaves together IIIF images, text, and layered contextual information into interactive digital narrative exhibitions. Learn more at [the Telar website](https://ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar)

For more information, visit the [Telar GitHub repository](https://github.com/UCSB-AMPLab/telar).

Telar was built with:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Static site generator
- [UniversalViewer](https://universalviewer.io/) - IIIF viewer
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- [iiif-static](https://github.com/bodleian/iiif-static-choices) - IIIF tile generator

It is based on [Paisajes Coloniales](https://paisajescoloniales.com/), and inspired by:
- [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) - Minimal computing for digital exhibitions
- [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) - Static digital collections
