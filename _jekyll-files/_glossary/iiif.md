The [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io) is a set of open standards developed by a global community of institutions and researchers to make image-based resources more accessible and interoperable on the Internet. First conceived in 2011 through collaboration between the British Library, Stanford University, Oxford University, and other institutions, IIIF addresses a fundamental problem: that collections worldwide hold millions of digitized images, but each institution traditionally used proprietary systems that made it difficult to view, compare, or work with images across different repositories.

The IIIF framework consists of several complementary APIs, most notably the [Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/) (for requesting image pixels at different sizes, regions, and formats) and the [Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/) (for describing sequences of images and their metadata in a standardized way). These APIs work together to enable sophisticated viewing experiences—deep zoom, comparison, annotation, and more—using any IIIF-compatible viewer or tool.

By 2025, IIIF has been adopted by over 500 institutions worldwide, including the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/), the [Vatican Library](https://digi.vatlib.it/), [Yale University](https://collections.library.yale.edu/), the [Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/), the [J. Paul Getty Museum](https://www.getty.edu/), and national libraries across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This creates an ecosystem where millions of images—manuscripts, maps, photographs, artworks, scientific illustrations—can be accessed, compared, and annotated using compatible tools regardless of where they are hosted. The [IIIF Consortium](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/) coordinates ongoing development of the standards, while an active [international community](https://iiif.io/community/) shares implementations, tools, and best practices.
